<TOEs combatant=Bulgaria>

	These TOEs are trying to reflect the full range of manpower assigned to field forces.
	Thus these TOEs generally include all support elements.  The reason is that the game
	model is designed to give each of these elements some role to play in the game.  In
	general, support functions are carried out automatically, so the player need not be
	concerned with managing those units unless they really feel the urge.

	I have tried to put significant efforts into producing good TOE's.  As I have uncovered
	ever more detailed TOE data on the respective combatants, I have realized that TOEs
	are a subject far more extensive than I want to address in its entirety (if that would 
	even be possible).  For example, the Germans alone issued thousands of different TOEs
	throughout the war.

	Even if someone were to uncover all of those TOEs and then code them, they would still
	be faced with the challenge of discovering whether and when any given field unit conformed 
	to that TOE or a different one.  Field units often did not change their composition
	for a long period of time when a new TOE was issued.  In other cases, old units retained
	their old structure alongside newer units raised under a different TOE.

	Knowing the designation (infantry, panzer, etc.) of a unit usually isn't enough to know
	the exact TOE of the unit.

	Plus, most units had variations of one sort or another that departed completely from any
	given TOE.  Independent units were routinely attached to larger formations for specific
	missions, but then stayed with their new organizations for long periods of time.  Units
	also periodically renumbered subunits so that temporary attachments dissolved into 
	permanent new organizations.

	Finally, forces deployed in quiet sectors, particularly German occupation troops, tended
	to acquire lots of ad hoc organization by scavenging captured equipment (since these units 
	rarely had priority for top of the line weapons).  But using captured equipment was not
	limited to esoteric outposts.  During the very battle of Kursk itself, a unit no less than 
	the SS Das Reich Division used Russian T-34 tanks because their Panthers were still back at
	the factory in Germany.

	The pratical reality is that the TOEs for this game have to be a simplified form of the
	actual force levels.
